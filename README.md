Swift-SpriteKit-MacIOS-Template
===============================

A template for creating cross platform SpriteKit games between iOS and Mac OS X using the Swift programming language.

It is set up with two targets, one for iOS and one for Mac OS X, you should be able to dump your SpriteKit game scenes straight in to the 'Shared Game' folder and get started pretty quickly.

It also includes a SKScene subclass called SKMScene which helps in handling screen touches or screen clicks. There is an example of it's usage included.

You can also find the Objective-C version of this template here: https://github.com/northy179/SpriteKit-cross-platform-iOS-Mac-Template
